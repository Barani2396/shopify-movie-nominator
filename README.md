# Shopify-Movie-Nominator

Simple react app to nominate movies from Open Movie Data Base (OMDB) list

## Insight

A plain site that picks movies from the OMDB and displays the random prelists to the user. A separate search bar is also provided to search the desired movies from the OMDB list. A user can nominate movies by choosing their favourite movies from this prelist or they can use the search bar to find the right movies. A separate grid/cart called Nominate List is embedded in the site to add those preferred movies.
